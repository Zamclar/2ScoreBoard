<!-- Lessons from CSS and HTML course
     
-HTML uses = CSS uses : for equals 
-Use flexbox for centering elements with css (you create a wrapper div for this) you can either select the element and just use the name of the element or the class, add a . before the name 

for Flexbox you need to create the wrapper div, give it a class name or use the element name on CSS then 2 more things

1- display: flex;
2- justify-content: center;
see example below with text buttons

Flexbox treats each element as an individual so to group them vertically you use a div, then the divs become what flexbox organizes horizontally
-->

<!--margin is outside space 
border is the actual border, padding is inside space
border takes 3 properties
border: 1px solid blue
-->

<!--
to center elements or classes you need 4 things
width: 300px; example (however, sometimes some elements have a inherit width so no needed)
display: block;
margin-right: auto;
margin-left: auto;
-->

<!--
AS A DESIGN FEATURE
you should leave more space on left and right for buttons and less space on top and bottom
-->


<!--
For height of a line box, you don't use Height only on CSS, it doesn't work in some browsers, so you use line-height
-->

<!--
text-align in CSS center the text and the button in the body element
-->

<!-- relative paths
HTML root directory location is /
./ is to look inside the same folder your html file is
../ is to go up one folder
-->

<!--ALT Text
all images should have the attribute alt="description of the image"
it helps with SEO 
-don't write "image of"
- should be less than 125 characters
- imagine you are describing it over the phone
-->


<!--
CREATING A UTILITY CLASS
a class for a single CSS property
i.e. class = "italic"
then create the class in CSS
font-style: italic;

an element in its container can have more than 1 class just separate using a space
<div class="card italic"> (make sure to only have a set of quotes to booked the classes, not a seet of quotes per each class)
  
So A Class basically is to give a div a name so you can alter in CSS and to alter the several divs with the same class with the properties given in CSS
-->

<!--
justify-content: Space-around;
provides space around the divs you give this CSS attribute to
-->

<!--
Display Felx is the same as display block, which takes all the available space horizontally-->

<!--CSS INHERITANCE
-helps write DRYer code (don't repeat yourself)
-Fewer bugs
-be more efficient

this inheritance will work on any numbers of levels in the tree
there is a list of 41 property that are inherited, not all CSS property are
-->

<!--
CMD + D allows you to select multiple instances in your HTML code of whatever you highlighted.
-->

<!--
There is a list of websafe fonts, that means the font recipe for rendering that font is alrady installed in the client(laptop, phone, etc)
in order to set the font 
Body {
font-family: Verdana, Genova, Tahoma, sans-serif: this is a font stack (Sans serif is a cateogry of fonts) (Serif has decorative strokes at the end of letters, Sans Serif doesn't)
}
-->

<!--SHORT HAND FOR MARGIN AND PADDING

margin: top right bottom left
margin: 10px 20px 30px 40px;

another case is 
margin top bottom right left
like Y axis and Z axis
margin 10px 10px auto auto
you can short hand
margin: 10px auto;

<!-- 
TO ADD BACKGROUND IMAGE to the website, you do so on CSS via this way
body {
   color: white;
    background-image: url("images/universe.jpg");
    background-size: cover;

    } -->


    <!-- HOW TO ADD GOOGLE FONTS
    Copy the code into the head of the HTML
    also the code into CSS for css

    font families are not inherit from body into buttons.
      you have to use 
      font-family: inherit;-->


      <!-- to add fonts from a download into css

      @font-face {
    src: url("Corleone.ttf");
    font-family: Corleone;

    after you have added it to your project folder
    than you have to give your elements the font family

    h1 {
    font-family: Corleone;
    }

    .ttf fonts are heavier on the website loadin time than WOFF2 fonts.

<!-- SPAN TAG <span> to underline text
  
  <div class="ad">
        <h1>You got the joker 🃏</h1>
        <h3>Click <span class="cta">here</span> to get your prize! 💰</h3>
    </div>

  <!-- in stead of CLASS you can use ID, the difference between them is ID is for unique items and use #before the name of the ID in CSS.
   you use CLASS when several elements will use the same CSS modifiers.

h1 {
  text-shadow: 5px -5px 5px black
              right down blur & color
}

 <!-- 
 ALIGN-TIEMS 
 USED FOR FLEX BOX TO GIVE TEXT A BACKGROUND COLOR 
 text is by default a block display, so it takes the whole width of the page. 
you can fix this by

display: flex;
flex-direction: column;
align-items: center; you can also use start or end Y axis
justify-content: center;  you can also use start or end X axis

 <!-- GRADIENT BACKGROUND  
background: linear-gradient(#14463d, #016a26);

    <!-- 
    Divs are not align they are display blocks -->

    <!-- 
    NAVIGATION
    there is an element also called <nav>
      in the body
      <nav>
            <a href="#">Menu</a>m     these are anchor tags that will link to other parts of our site.
            <a href="#">Book a table</a> the # is only a place holder, it will not direct us to any other location
            <a href="#">Catering</a>
        </nav>
    -->

    <!-- 
    BACKGROUND IMAGES DON'T HAVE ALT TEXT.
    
    we use WAI-ARIA

    YOU WOULD ADD to the div element

    role="img">

    then to provide the alt text, we use the aria-label attribute

    aria-label="two friends cheering and jumping"

    but since we did a hover over change to a gif.

    aria-label="A wrapped present. When hovered over, it changes to reveal a GIF of two friends cheering and jumping.""
